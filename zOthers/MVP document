Game name: "XXXXXX"

Game description: 

Our game will try to imitate the famous "Pokemon" videogame. In our version, the main character will move vertically and horizontally through a world with different areas that he can access: city, forest, lake, mountain...

 

In each of these areas, our character will be able to randomly come across a type of animal. When both meet, the game screen will change to something similar to the following image:

On this screen you will see our character from behind and the animal that we have found from the front. Next to the animal, a text box will appear with its "name" and its "health" (in percentage or bar). Underneath, a message will appear stating that "we have encountered X animal".

Next, an option menu will appear that will allow us to choose between two options: "fight" or "run". If we choose the "run" option, we will return to the map screen and we can continue moving freely around the map.

If we choose the "fight" option, a small option menu will appear in which we can choose the animal we want from our collection, starting then a fight between our animal and the one we have found. During the fight, each animal will have a text box next to it with its "name" and its "health" bar or percentage, which will decrease with each attack it receives.



The objective of the game is to weaken the animal enough to be able to capture it and include it in our collection.
